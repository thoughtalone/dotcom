# Fascism is not Fascist
## DRAFT

### Reducing Politics to Psychology 
The left of the academic humanities has, for some time, analysed political and economic "predicaments" in psycho-analytic terms. 

In particular, they reduce the geopolitical situation of 1930s italy down to a psychological malady which is constitued by "nationalism, ethnic pride, nostalgia for a ethnic past".

With this analysis in hand, they claim that the reason fascist italy was so brutal, anti-democratic, and oppressive is that its leadership (and perhaps people) were beset by this malady.

And of course, "fascism" in this psycho-analytic sense, is at work in america today: and so, we are indanger of a 1930s style tyranny.

## Everyone is Fascist so no one is Fascist

The problem with this analysis is that every society in history has been, in these terms, "fascist". Indeed, by this analysis, america is today fascist. And yet, there is no mass murder afoot. 

The problem here is that a world view, or set of psychological dispoitions, do not lead to any particular society. 1930s italy wasn't fascist because it's people had an "ethic pride". 

The 30s occured because of the first world war, and in particular, required a mass impoverisment, mass deversation and mass trauma to many millions. Europe of the early 20th century was a desperately poor, limiting and bleak place.

It is these economic, political and geopolitical conditions that give rise to an in-fact aggressive, oppresive and bloody regieme. 

## Self-Deception and Alarmism

By explaining tyranny in these terms the leftwing academic, or activist, can execute their self-righteous agenda against basic human setiments as old as human society: the preference for one's people over others; a nostalgia for one's childhood; a belief that a community of commonality is less fractuous than a community of difference.

These sentiments when applied to ethnicity are exactly the same at-work in the mind of Donald Trump as a religious community.

Academics regard their own in-group preference ("fascism") as the proper default. They create highly homogenised societies called "universities" or "activist groups", whose integreity they protect, covet and cherish. And for which they have an unabashed nostalgia for a "time before when everything was right". 

This is to say when other people do it, it is fascism. And fascism of the mind leads to fascism of society, and so, let us expect Trump to execute a miltary coup and for hundreds of millions of Americans to participate.

## Dangerous Buffoons

This sort of analysis would be charmingly naive if not for antifascist activist groups who have fallen for it. Specific actions of allegedly "fascist" groups needs analysed in their own specifics, and it is likely that some of these groups are concerning.

However fascit italy did not occur because of "ethnic nostalgia" with a full low-status down-and-out men wandering around parading in nazi cosplay. Dozens of millions of people had to die, and an entire continent had to be in a state of extreme poverty.

The world is so unimaingable rich today, and stable, that even the last -- unprecedented -- financial crisis was insufficient to create mass authoritarian movements. 

This analysis however serves to sanction the sometimes violent, and always alarmist, actions of the activist left. Without any doubt, the most powerful response to nazi cosplay is to ignore it. By elevating a few angry men to the level of a geopolitical threat, the left are increasingly dangerous buffoons.
